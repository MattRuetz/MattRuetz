# Hey! I’m Matt Ruetz
### 👀 I’m interested in ...
- All sorts of topics, but the most fascinating areas to me involve the resultant phenomena of low-level interractions. Complex behaviour and robust functionality derived from simple rules. The feeling of awe from creating something that has a personality and existence unto itself. That's why I love to code.
- I have experience in web development, expecially with HTML/CSS/JS, and recently with higher-level frameworks such as Node.JS, Typescript, React. I also have backend experience using PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Firestore.
- Learning and improving every day.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Recently I've been exploring the many different modalities of web development. I think the modern landscape of the Web is one of the fastest-evolving and most exciting areas to work in.
- I have been learning React by creating multiple demo applications, and trying a variety of NPM packages to add functionality and more advanced features. There's always more to learn, and I love it.
- I embrace lifelong learning, and continue to experiment with new technologies out of passion and curiosity.


### 💞️ Let's Collab!
- I just love learning, teaching, and creating - especially all at once.
- Any projects that spark my interest and seem to be a challenge that would expand my abilities and knowledge, or could help someone else achieve the same.
