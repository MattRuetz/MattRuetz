## I’m Matt
### 👀 I’m interested in ...
- Fullstack web development (HTML/CSS/JS) with Node.JS, React, Redux, Express, Typescript,  and lots more. I also have some backend experience using relational and non-relational databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Firestore.
- Learning and improving every day.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Different technologies and full stacks for web development. I think the modern landscape of the Web is one of the fastest-evolving and most exciting areas to work in.
- I have been learning React and the MERN stack by creating a bunch of applications and trying out a variety of NPM packages to add functionality.
- I embrace lifelong learning, and continue to experiment with new technologies whenever I can.

### 💞️ Let's Collab!
- I enjoy learning, teaching, and creating - especially all at once.
- Any projects that sparks my interest, or could help me or someone else learn and improve.
